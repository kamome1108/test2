# AI Research Agent

This repository contains a simple prototype script `ai_research_agent.py`.
It demonstrates a skeleton of the personal AI research agent described in
the design document.

The script is not fully functional by default. To run it locally, install
required packages such as `PyQt6`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`,
`selenium`, and `pytesseract`. Then execute:

```bash
python ai_research_agent.py
```
