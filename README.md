# AI Research Agent

This repository contains a prototype implementation of the personal AI research agent.
For an overview of the planned features, see [design.md](design.md).

The script is not fully functional by default. To try it locally, install required packages such as `PyQt6`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `selenium`, and `pytesseract`.

```bash
python ai_research_agent.py
```
